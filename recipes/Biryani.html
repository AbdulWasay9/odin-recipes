    <h3>
        Instructions
    </h3>
    <ol>

        <li>
            Marinate the chicken in spices and yogurt.
            This infuses the chicken with noticeable flavor.
        </li>

        <li>
            Take the chicken out of the fridge before you start preparing the biryani.
            Allowing the chicken to come closer to room temperature helps it cook more evenly and stay tender.
        </li>

        <li>
            Lastly, after saut√©ing the chicken in the hot oil, add water and allow the chicken to simmer gently,
            covered, over low heat.
        </li>

        <li>
            Boil the rice in water, at low heat, to avoid breaking them.
        </li>

        <li>
            Mix and combine the chicken curry and the cooked rice, in a big pot, when combined let it simmer for 15
            minutes.
