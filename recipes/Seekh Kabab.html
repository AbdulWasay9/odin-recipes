    <h3>
        Instructions
    </h3>
    <ol>

        <li>
            Add the Meat, onion, cilantro, mint, and green chili peppers to a food processor. Using the pulse function,
            finely chop (but not blend) them to a coarse mixture
        </li>

        <li>
            Add the salt, garlic, ginger, black pepper, red chili flakes, in to the minced meat.
        </li>

        <li>
            Using gloved hands (do not use bare hands or the green chili may sting), knead for 3-4 minutes, until you
            begin to see a lacy, stringy texture
        </li>

        <li>
            Cover the bowl and set aside for 30 minutes, or refrigerate up to overnight.
        </li>

        <li>
            Using oiled hands, take around 1/4 cup of themeat and form into a hearty round shape. Run the kebab skewers
            through the meat and use your hands to form a sausage-like shape around the skewer. It should come to 5-6
            inches long.
        </li>

        <li>
            Heat a large, nonstick or cast iron skillet over medium or medium-high heat. Add enough oil to coat the
            bottom of
            the pan. When the oil is hot, place the kebabs on the pan, making sure not to crowd them. Use tongs to turn
            the
            kebabs frequently, making sure all sides are browned evenly. Cook for 6-7 minutes in total. If you have a
            meat
            thermometer, it should read at least 160 Â°F. Transfer the kebabs to a large plate lined with a paper towel.

        </li>
